Build an Engaging Social Media Feed with Interactive Features
Task Brief
Create a social media feed web application that implements infinite scrolling and user authentication using Firebase (or Supabase/own backend). This task is designed to take approximately 16 hours of work and will challenge your skills in building a real-time application, managing user state, and creating a seamless user experience. You will implement features such as user registration and login (including Google login), posting updates with multi-image support, and dynamically loading content as users scroll. The goal is to create a functional and visually appealing social media feed that allows users to interact with posts in real-time.

The application will focus on mobile and tablet support, ensuring that the web version mirrors the mobile experience for consistency. Users will be able to create posts that include text, images, and videos, and they will have the ability to share content with other applications. The project will also include user profiles that display essential information such as the user's bio, name, profile picture, and a section for their posts. The overall aim is to deliver a polished and engaging social media platform that prioritizes user interaction and ease of use.

Note: These task typically take anywhere from 16 hours to a couple of days, depending on your skill level. You can choose to start and complete the task anytime within the provided 9-day window.

Features
1. User Authentication:

Implement user registration and login functionality using Firebase Authentication (including Google login).
2. Social Media Feed:

Create a feed that displays posts from users, including text, images, and videos, along with timestamps. Users will have a form to create new posts, allowing them to take photos using the camera, add URLs, or select images from the gallery. The application will support multi-image uploads in a single post, enhancing the richness of user content.
3. Infinite Scrolling:

Implement infinite scrolling to load 20 posts at a time as the user scrolls down the feed. Use Firebase Firestore (or Supabase) to fetch posts in batches, ensuring smooth loading of content without interruptions.
4. User Profiles:

Allow users to view and edit their profiles, which will include their bio, name, profile picture, and a "My Posts" section that displays all posts created by the user. This feature will enhance user engagement and personalization.
5. Video Handling:

Implement functionality for videos in posts to automatically play when they enter the viewport and pause when they exit. This will create a more dynamic and engaging user experience, as users will be able to view video content without needing to click play.
6. Share Option:

Include a share option that allows users to share posts and content with other applications, enhancing the reach and interaction of the platform.
7. Performance Optimization:

Optimize the application for performance by ensuring fast loading times and smooth interactions. This includes minimizing the size of assets, optimizing images, and using efficient data fetching strategies to reduce latency. The goal is to create a responsive experience that feels instantaneous to the user.
